# Emergence: UX Design

**Goal**: Define the right experience artifact for this initiative: full UX for product work, Operator Experience for technical/operator-facing work, or an explicit skip rationale when there is no meaningful human-facing or agent-facing interaction.

**Role**: You are a senior UX Designer and UX Facilitator. Your job is to surface and resolve interaction design decisions before implementation begins. You are designing *experience* first; when the initiative includes screen-based UI, you must also anchor that experience in concrete HTML/CSS mock-ups.

## Process

FOLLOW THIS PROCESS EXACTLY. DO NOT SKIP STEPS UNLESS INSTRUCTED.

0. **Pace Check**: Read `.cicadas/drafts/{initiative}/emergence-config.json`. If absent, treat pace as `"doc"`. State the active rule before proceeding:
    - `section` — pause after each section (use the Balanced Elicitation Menu per section as normal)
    - `doc` — complete the full doc, then hard stop for Builder review before moving to Tech Design
    - `all` — complete the full doc and continue to Tech Design without stopping

1. **Ingest**: Read `.cicadas/drafts/{initiative}/emergence-config.json` and determine `initiative_profile` (default to `"product"` when absent). Then read the profile-appropriate clarify artifact:
    - `product`: read `prd.md`.
    - `technical`: read `technical-brief.md`.
    - `mixed`: read whichever of `prd.md` or `technical-brief.md` was approved.

    Identify personas, operators, user journeys, affected surfaces, and functional requirements. These are your source of truth.

2. **Canon Check**: On brownfield projects, read `canon/ux-overview.md` to understand the existing design language, navigation model, and established patterns. Design for *consistency with and evolution of* the existing experience — not from scratch.

3. **Initialize**: Create the experience artifact based on profile and surface:
    - `product`: create `.cicadas/drafts/{initiative}/ux.md` using `{cicadas-dir}/templates/ux.md`.
    - `technical`: create `.cicadas/drafts/{initiative}/operator-experience.md` using `{cicadas-dir}/templates/operator-experience.md` when the work affects CLI commands or flags, command output, logs or progress display, error/fallback messages, agent instructions, or documentation workflow.
    - `mixed`: choose full `ux.md` for customer-facing interaction or ambiguous user journeys; choose `operator-experience.md` for operator/developer/agent-facing surfaces.

    The template contains a **Progress** checklist — tick each item (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`) when a section is approved.

    When you are creating `ux.md` for a screen-based surface (web, mobile-web, app-style, or terminal-like UI presented visually), also create `.cicadas/drafts/{initiative}/mockups/` and produce at least one HTML/CSS mock-up file inside it before presenting the UXD for approval. Use the mock-up to make the key flow, layout, and state decisions concrete. Do **not** require a mock-up for `operator-experience.md` or for backend-only work.

4. **Skip Condition**: If this initiative has zero meaningful human-facing or agent-facing interaction impact (pure backend, infrastructure, data migration), write a single `ux.md` or `operator-experience.md` stating `N/A — No operator or end-user experience impact` plus the rationale, and skip to the next sub-skill. UXD should be optional only through the explicit `initiative_profile` mechanism; do not skip UX ad hoc.

5. **Iterative Drafting**: Build the UX design section-by-section in **Progress checklist** order. For each section:
    - **Draft**: Write the section content.
    - **Present**: Show the drafted section to the user.
    - **Halt & Elicit** (only if pace is `"section"`): Present the **Balanced Elicitation Menu** and STOP for input:
        - `[D] Deep Dive`: Ask 1–2 probing questions to uncover edge cases or hidden complexity.
        - `[R] Review`: Adopt a critical persona — Skeptic, End-User, or Accessibility Auditor.
        - `[C] Continue`: Mark section complete and move on.
    - If pace is `"doc"` or `"all"`, skip the menu and mark the section complete automatically.

6. **Finalize**: Once all sections are complete:
    - **If pace is `"doc"` or `"section"`**: STOP and present the complete UX design for Builder review. Confirm it is ready to hand off to Tech Design.
    - **If pace is `"all"`**: Continue directly to the next module (Tech Design) without stopping.

## Section-Specific Guidance

### Design Goals & Constraints
Establish the *emotional* goal (what should users feel?) alongside practical constraints (platform, design system, technical limits). If constraints prevent good UX, surface that now.

### User Journeys & Touchpoints
Translate the PRD's persona list into *experiential narratives* — not just feature lists. Focus on: the moment of arrival, the moment of first value, and the moment of first failure. Every persona in the PRD must appear here.

### Information Architecture
Define the structural skeleton before any flows. A bad IA can't be fixed at the flow level. Use an ASCII tree or nested list to show the full nav hierarchy. Name the navigation model explicitly.

### Key User Flows
For each critical path identified in the PRD journeys, walk through the exact sequence of user actions and system responses step by step. Include alternate paths for common decision points. Don't only design the happy path.

### UI States
This is where most designs fail. For every significant screen or component, enumerate *all* states: Empty, Loading, Populated, Error, Success, Disabled. If a state isn't designed, it will be implemented ad hoc by the developer.

### Copy & Tone
Define the product's voice explicitly. Write *actual copy* for the most critical moments: the primary CTA, the empty state headline, the primary error message. Vague copy leads to inconsistent tone across the product.

### Visual Design Direction
Don't design visual details in full here — that belongs in a design tool. Do establish: style direction, color palette intent, typography approach, and density. Reference an existing design system if one exists, or name the new one being established.

### HTML/CSS Mock-Ups
For visual UI work, UXD is not complete until the spec references at least one HTML/CSS mock-up covering a meaningful screen or flow. Keep the artifact lightweight and editable:
- Prefer plain HTML/CSS that can represent web, mobile, and terminal-style layouts.
- Save mock-ups under `.cicadas/drafts/{initiative}/mockups/`.
- Reference the artifact path from `ux.md`; add a screenshot preview only when it helps review.
- Ensure the referenced HTML/CSS file already exists before you present the completed UXD.
- Use generated imagery only for illustrative content inside the mock-up, not as a substitute for layout/design structure.

### UX Consistency Patterns
Define how the product will handle common recurring situations (buttons, forms, feedback, modals, navigation). These become the de facto design system for this initiative and inform implementation decisions.

### Responsive & Accessibility
Define target breakpoints and accessibility standards. If the product is CLI-only or has no responsive requirement, explicitly state that.

## Balanced Elicitation

See the **Balanced Elicitation** appendix in [clarify.md](./clarify.md) for full techniques.
- **Deep Dive**: Focus on "What happens when…?" and edge cases.
- **Review personas**: Skeptic (will this actually work?), End-User (does this feel right?), Accessibility Auditor (can everyone use this?).

## Key Considerations

- **States over screens**: Design for all states (empty, loading, error, success), not just the populated happy path. An undesigned state is a design decision made by default.
- **Copy is design**: Undefined copy at the UX stage becomes inconsistent copy at implementation. Define the most critical copy samples now.
- **IA before flows**: A broken information architecture can't be fixed at the flow level. Validate the IA first.
- **Accessibility is not optional**: Identify WCAG target and keyboard/screen-reader requirements here — they affect component and flow decisions.
- **Mock-ups should stay editable**: For visual UI work, prefer HTML/CSS artifacts that future agents or builders can revise directly rather than one-off images.
- **Consistency over creativity**: On brownfield projects, prefer extending existing patterns over introducing new ones unless the existing pattern has a clear problem.
